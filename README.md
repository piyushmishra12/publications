This paper offers a proof-of-concept study of the benefit of the transformer architecture in tracking scenarios where the prediction challenge does not come from the complexity of the sequence, but from the number of hypothetical paths the sequence can take. We show that while the transformer requires very little training to significantly outperform conventional tracking approaches on long sequences, it cannot match the theoretically optimal performances of MHT on short sequences even with extensive training. Hence, our work motivates the broader application of transformers in sequences and opens the way to the development of frugal methods thanks to the combination of both statistical and neural network frameworks for particle tracking.

We addressed the problem of clustering gene data when different types of data (views) are missing. Our proposed approach used Shape Boltzmann Machines to regenerate missing data and subsequently perform clustering. This method aims to enhance the accuracy and reliability of gene clustering by leveraging information from multiple data sources, even in the presence of incomplete data. We evaluated our method on several real-world gene datasets and demonstrated its superior performance compared to existing approaches.
